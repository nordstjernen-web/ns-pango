/* Pango has no cache that outlives a NsPangoLayout, so a browser that measures
 * a run and then paints it, or that asks for min-content and max-content before
 * laying a cell out, shapes the same bytes with the same font several times
 * over. This keeps the finished glyph string, keyed on everything hb_shape
 * reads.
 *
 * An item is only cached when its shaping cannot depend on the text around it:
 * HarfBuzz is given the paragraph as pre- and post-context, so an item that
 * starts or ends mid-word may join, reorder or ligate across its own boundary.
 * A boundary is independent when the character on either side of it neither
 * joins nor ligates: most space characters, or an ideograph, kana letter or
 * Hangul syllable, which are written without spaces and never join. See
 * boundary_char() for what is deliberately left out of both of those.

 * gets its own NsPangoFont objects too -- and the key names the font, so
 * nothing one thread shapes can be served to another. Threads therefore all
 * miss, all take the lock exclusively to insert, and all serialise behind each
 * other's memcpy. Measured over the corpus on four cores, one table was worth
 * 1.9x over no cache at all on one thread and only 1.2x on four.
 *
 * Splitting the table on the high bits of the hash, which the table's own
 * bucket index does not use, gives each shard its own lock. Two threads
 * inserting different runs now only collide one time in NS_SHAPE_CACHE_SHARDS,
 * which is a quarter more four-thread throughput and nothing at all on one.

 * neighbour is a boundary, so that both sides of every cut sit next to one.
 *
 * A run of spaces stays with the word before it rather than starting the next
 * piece, because the line breaker leaves trailing spaces on the line it broke
 * -- so "keeps " is what a wrapped line ends with, and what the paragraph
 * contains. Cutting the other way would make those two different pieces.
 *
 * The cut must be a function of the bytes alone and of nothing around them,
 * or the same word would be cut differently depending on which item it turned
 * up in, and the pieces would never match.
 *
 * Only a space will do, never an ideograph -- although an ideograph is a
 * boundary good enough to admit a whole item, which begins and ends where the
 * itemiser put it. Noto Sans CJK adjusts an ideograph's advance against the one
 * beside it, so cutting between two of them and keeping the halves separately
 * gives each the width it had next to whatever happened to follow it that time:
 * 15360 in one paragraph and 14336 in the next. The fork's own dump caught it
